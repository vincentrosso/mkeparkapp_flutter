Architecture and code structure

- Entry point: lib/main.dart
  - DeezParkApp configures a MaterialApp with a global dark-green theme and named routes.
  - Routes:
    - '/': WelcomeScreen
    - '/parking': ParkingScreen
    - '/permit': PermitScreen
    - '/sweeping': StreetSweepingScreen

- Screens: lib/screens/*.dart
  - Each page is a StatelessWidget with its own Scaffold and page-specific AppBar.
  - Navigation uses Navigator.pushNamed with the routes above.
  - ParkingScreen defines a Drawer for app navigation; main.dart also defines a withDrawer(...) helper that is currently not applied, so drawer usage is per-screen rather than centralized.

- Additional screens present but not currently wired in routes
  - history_screen.dart, landing_screen.dart

- Lint configuration
  - analysis_options.yaml includes package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

Repo-specific notes

- The template test at test/widget_test.dart references MyApp, but the appâ€™s entry widget is DeezParkApp. If tests are enabled, update the test to pump DeezParkApp (or add a MyApp alias) before expecting them to pass.
